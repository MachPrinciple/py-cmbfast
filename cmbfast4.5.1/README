To compile the code first build 
the Makefile with the configure script.
(The configure script and Makefile were provided by Matthias
Bartelmann, many thanks !!!)

The configure script has many options, try

configure --help 

for help. Typing configure with no options will creat the
default Makefile.

Once the configure script has created the Makefile
type make and the code should compile with the
requested options. You may have to delete the object files 
before make will do anything, just type make clean.

We encourage you to go over the examples in the 
EXAMPLE directory and the documentation in the DOC directory.

Have fun,

Uros and Matias
