This is a README for running CMBFAST in parallel. It uses LAM/MPI 
and can run on clusters with distributed memory (beowulf clusters). 
So far it was only tested on PGI fortran and does not work with g77.
The strategy is to distribute individual k modes onto separate nodes. 
Since the running time for each k mode increases with amplitude of k 
the efficiency decreases with number of nodes. Recommended number is 8 nodes.

WARNING: this option is provided as is and there is no software support 
from the authors.

Instructions:

in RUN/Makefile edit NUMHDD=number of machines with local disks -1, 
NUMPROC=number of processors, LOCALDATADIR=local directory for input files

example: 
NUMHDD=6
NUMPROC=14
LOCALDATADIR=/var/tmp/uros/1


or if individual processors have no local disks then 

NUMHDD=0
NUMPROC=14
LOCALDATADIR=./d

In ~/.bashrc put 
export LAMHF77=pgf90

an example to configure is in conf, run 

./conf

cd RUN

generate jl.dat and if needed also 
ujl.dat, eos.dat amd jlens.dat (note that the names must match)

cd .. 

make
 
cd RUN

an example to run is

./cmb_mpi
