We are including subroutines that output results in fits format
ready for use by the HEALPIX package to generate maps. 

In order to use these routines you need to have the fits libaries
installed in your machine and compile cmbfast 
with the FITS option. To do this you can type 
configure --with-fits=yes
make
or you could add -DFITS to your manual  compilation lines, eg.
f77 -c -DFITS driver.F. In the latter case
you will then have to add the library options to the 
cmb compilation. See the Makefile for details. 

You should also make sure that the FITSDIR variable in Makefile
points to the location of the fits library files. 

WARNING: the code will give an error if the file selected for
the fits output already exists.
