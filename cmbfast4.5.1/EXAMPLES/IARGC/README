The IARGC options allows for inputs directly in the
command line for jlgen, ujlgen and jlens and form a file 
for cmb. The example script shows how the files in this 
directory were generated. 

These are the explanations of the entries of the 
input file (which correspond to the questions in the 
driver).

To compile CMBFAST with this option use
configure --with-iargc=yes
and then make.
